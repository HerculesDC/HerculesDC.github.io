    <p id="desc">This is a simple project I used to try p5.js.
    Even though p5 has 3D capabilities, this project was made entirely in 2D, due
    to platform limitations where I originally coded it (which actually used the
    now-deprecated Processing.js library). I tried to give it a 3D-ish feel using
    a couple of the platform's features such as transparency.<br>
    The Moon is not an actual circle: it's a combination of four Bezier curves,
    with their control points spaced to best approximate a circle. This setup also
    allowed me to manipulate each Bezier vertex to draw a crescent according to the
    moon phase. The transparency also helps draw a more-or-less convincing 
    terminator, simulating 3D illumination.<br>
    The canvas also implements a slight rotation as the moon rotates; this effect
    simulates the Moon's libration<br>
    By clicking on the page, the user can flip the moon's rotation. Doing this 
    updates the phase names accordingly, as the names are calculated at runtime 
    based on the moon's phase angle.
