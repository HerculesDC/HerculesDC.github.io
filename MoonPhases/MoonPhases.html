    <p>This is a simple project I used to try p5.js.
    Even though p5 has 3D capabilities, this project was made entirely in 2D, due
    to platform limitations where I originally coded it. I tried to give it a 
    3D-ish feel using a couple of the platform's different features such as
    transparency.
    The Moon is not an actual circle: it's a combination of four Bezier curves,
    with their control points spaced to best approximate a circle. This setup also
    allowed me to manipulate each Bezier vertex to draw a crescent according to the
    moon phase. The transparency also helps draw a more-or-less convincing 
    terminator, simulating 3D illumination.
