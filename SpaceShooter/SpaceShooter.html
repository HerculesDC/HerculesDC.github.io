    <h1>Space Shooter</h1>
    <p id="desc">
        This is a generic 2D top-down shooter/bullet hell project I'm prototyping using Python/pygame and P5.js on codepen.io.
    </p>
    <p id="desc">
        The choice of languages/libraries stem basically from the fact that both are fairly easy to use. I used p5 to design the particles I intended to use, and loaded the generated pngs into pygame to see how they looked. In the future, my idea is to port the code to a C++ engine with SDL and use Lua as a scripting language.
